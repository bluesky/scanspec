Running a GraphQL service for generating points
===============================================

The `creating-a-spec` tutorial shows how you would use the commandline client to
plot a `Spec`. This maps nicely to using scanspec in a commandline utility, but
not if you want to expose those points to a web GUI. To do this we will bring up
a GraphQL_ service that allows a web GUI to request the points it would like to
plot.

Running the server
------------------

In a terminal, run::

    $ scanspec service --cors
    ======== Running on http://localhost:8080 ========
    (Press CTRL+C to quit)

You can now open a browser to http://localhost:8080/graphql and see a GraphiQL_ editor
which will allow you to send GraphQL queries to the server.

.. note::

    All the examples below will embed a GraphiQL_ editor in your browser. If you
    refresh your browser, they will contact the scanspec service you are running
    and become live: you can modify the queries and press the play button to get
    an updated response from the server. If the server is not running (or you
    didn't pass ``--cors`` to it) then the play button will not be visible.


Validating a Spec
-----------------

The first use case for our service is producing the canonical serialization of a
Spec. Some of the Specs like `Line.bounded` will return an instance of Line that
has different parameters to those that are passed.

For example, on the commandline we might do::

    >>> from scanspec.specs import Line
    >>> Line.bounded("x", 0, 1, 5).serialize()
    {'Line': {'axis': 'x', 'start': 0.1, 'stop': 0.9, 'num': 5}}

.. seealso:: `serialize-a-spec`

The equivalent in our service is:

.. graphiql:: http://localhost:8080/graphql
    :query:
      {
        validateSpec(
          spec: {
            BoundedLine: {
              axis: "x"
              lower: 0
              upper: 1
              num: 5
            }
          }
        )
      }
    :response:
      {
        "data": {
          "validateSpec": {
            "Line": {
              "axis": "x",
              "start": 0.1,
              "stop": 0.9,
              "num": 5
            }
          }
        }
      }

Getting Points from a Spec
--------------------------

More important is the ability to obtain a list of scan frames from a Spec. 
GraphQL gives the user the ability to request one or more fields from an object, 
allowing them to obtain data that is relevant only to their application.

The 'getPoints' query makes use of this, giving users the ability to select from
one or more of the following fields:

- axes: a list of axes present in the Spec and its associated scan points
- totalFrames: the total number of frames produced by the Spec
- returnedFrames: the number of frames returned, limited by the maxFrames argument
- smallestAbsStep: the smallest step between midpoints across ALL axes in the scan

Within axes:

- axis: the name of the axis present in the Spec
- lower: a list of lower bounds that are each present in a frame
- midpoints: a list of midpoints that are each present in a frame
- upper: a list of upper bounds that are each present in a frame
- smallestStep: the smallest step between midpoints in this axis of the scan

Within lower, middle and upper:

- string: returns the requested points as a human readable truncated numpy formatted 
  string for debugging
- floatList: returns the requested points as a list of floats
- b64: returns the requested points encoded into base64

Using the example above, we can request to return points from it:

.. graphiql:: http://localhost:8080/graphql
    :query:
      {
        getPoints(
          spec: {
            BoundedLine: {
              axis: "x"
              lower: 0
              upper: 1
              num: 5
            }
          }
        )
        {
          returnedFrames
          axes {
            axis
            upper {
              string
            }
            midpoints{
              floatList
            }
            lower{
              b64
            }
          }
        }
      }
    :response:
      {
        "data": {
          "getPoints": {
            "returnedFrames": 5,
            "axes": [
              {
                "axis": "x",
                "upper": {
                  "string": "[0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1. ]"
                },
                "midpoints": {
                  "floatList": [
                    0.1,
                    0.30000000000000004,
                    0.5,
                    0.7000000000000001,
                    0.9
                  ]
                },
                "lower": {
                  "b64": "AAAAAAAAAACamZmZmZnJP5qZmZmZmdk/NDMzMzMz4z+amZmZmZnpPw=="
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }

Masking a region of a spec
--------------------------

Regions can be used to mask a Spec as described in `creating-a-spec`. Consider
the following spec:

.. example_spec::

    from scanspec.specs import Line
    from scanspec.regions import Circle

    spec = Line("x", 0, 10, 5) * Line("y", 0, 10, 5) & Circle("x", "y", 5, 5, 3)


We could query the service for the points information like so:

.. graphiql:: http://localhost:8080/graphql
    :query:
      {
        getPoints(
          spec: {
            Mask: {
              spec: {
                Product: {
                  outer: {
                    Line: {
                      axis: "x", 
                      start: 0, 
                      stop: 10, 
                      num: 5
                    }
                  }, 
                  inner: {
                    Line: {
                      axis: "y", 
                      start: 0, 
                      stop: 10, 
                      num: 5
                    }
                  }
                }
              }, 
              region: {
                Circle: {
                  xAxis: "x", 
                  yAxis: "y", 
                  xMiddle: 5, 
                  yMiddle: 5, 
                  radius: 3
                }
              }
            }
          }
        ) 
        {
          totalFrames
          axes {
            axis
            midpoints {
              floatList
            }
          }
        }
      }
    :response:
      {
        "data": {
          "getPoints": {
            "totalFrames": 5,
            "axes": [
              {
                "axis": "x",
                "midpoints": {
                  "floatList": [
                    2.5,
                    5,
                    5,
                    5,
                    7.5
                  ]
                }
              },
              {
                "axis": "y",
                "midpoints": {
                  "floatList": [
                    5,
                    2.5,
                    5,
                    7.5,
                    5
                  ]
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
