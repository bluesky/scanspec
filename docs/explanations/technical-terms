`Dimension <scanspec.core.Dimension>`: A repeatable, possibly snaking 
structure of frames along a number of axes.

`Frame <scanspec.service.AxisFrames>`: A vector of three points in scan space: 
lower, midpoint, upper (used for fly scanning).

`Path <scanspec.core.Path>`: A consumable route through one or more 
dimensions.

`Point <scanspec.core.AxesPoints>`: A single or multidimensional location 
in scan space.

`Spec <scanspec.specs.Spec>`: A serializable representation of the type, 
parameters and axis names required to produce one or more dimensions.
