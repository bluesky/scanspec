number of axes.

Frame:
A frame is a vector of three points (lower, midpoints, upper) in scan space.

Path:
A path is a consumable route through one or more dimensions.

Point:
A point is a single or multidimensional location in scan space.

Spec:
A spec is a serializable representation of the type, parameters 
and axis names required to produce one or more dimensions.
